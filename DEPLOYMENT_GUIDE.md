# Build - Deployment Guide

## Environment Variables

### Render (Backend)

Set these in Render Dashboard → Environment:

```
CLIENT_URL=https://vora-client.vercel.app

**Important:**
- `VITE_API_URL` should be your Render backend URL + `/api`

### ⚠️ Feature 7: Screen Share
**Note:** Screen share requires WebRTC which may have connectivity issues on free tiers due to NAT/firewall. For production, consider TURN servers.

**Test Screen Share:**
1. Open room in 2 different browsers/devices
2. User 1: Click "Start Share" button
3. Browser prompts for screen/window selection
4. After selection, video should appear
5. User 2: Should automatically see the shared screen
6. User 1: Click "Stop Share" - sharing ends for all
7. Only one person can share at a time (error shown if someone else is sharing)

**Known Limitations:**
- Uses free STUN server (stun.l.google.com)
- May not work behind strict firewalls/NAT
- For production, add TURN server configuration
